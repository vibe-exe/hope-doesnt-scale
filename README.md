## About

This is not an album.  
It’s a retrospective disguised as lofi.  
A slow, ambient postmortem for a startup that never launched—but definitely crashed.

**Hope Doesn’t Scale** is 13 tracks of melancholy, false confidence, and quietly unresolved feature requests.  
Written by AI. Mixed in a fugue state.  
Brought to you by someone who still checks their metrics even though the app’s been offline for six months.

It's not just code. It's not just vibes.  
It’s **coping as a service**.

## Installation

```bash
npm install delusion
cd ~/disappointment
yarn start --force

## Track Highlights
It's Working, But I Don’t Know Why – a developer love song to chaos

Emotional Tech Debt – no one’s refactored in months, especially not emotionally

Hope Doesn’t Scale – the title track and emotional root cause

Exit Strategy (Is Starbucks Hiring?) – the only job still hiring after the dream dies

## Known Bugs
Listening may cause involuntary flashbacks to late-stage bootstrapping

Tracks may loop, emotionally

You might start a side project you’ll never finish

May inspire you to open VS Code just to feel something
